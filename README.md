# DailyPracticeApp
A container app to run H5P problem sets

## What is a Daily Practice App? 


Fitness apps paved the way, language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel or Chatterbug have already successfully copied it: In order to retain newly learned concepts and actually build new competencies, regular practice is key. And in order to build a habit of regular practice, apps using nudging and gamification can be extremely helpful. As an example, DataCamp has already successfully implemented such an app for learning how to program.  



## How can we build such an app ourselves? 


We need practice problems. Many practice problems. These can be really small and easy questions, ideally with a few parameters that can be randomized. And then we just need an app that can render these problems. AI Campus already has a large collection of H5P problem sets for our AI related courses. So now, we only need to build a container app that can show these problems and save the results. Et voil√°! This can then be used by anyone to render their own H5P problem sets.
