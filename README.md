# DailyPracticeApp
A container app to run [H5P](https://h5p.org/) problem sets

Developed during [Semesterhack 2.0](https://digieduhack.com/en/berlin-semesterhack-2-0-in-german-english) at [DigiEduHack 2020](https://digieduhack.com/en/). This is our [submission page](https://digieduhack.com/en/solutions/the-daily-practice-app-not-only-for-the-ai-campus). 


## What is a Daily Practice App? 


Fitness apps paved the way, language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel or Chatterbug have already successfully copied it: In order to retain newly learned concepts and actually build new competencies, regular practice is key. And in order to build a habit of regular practice, apps using nudging and gamification can be extremely helpful. As an example, DataCamp has already successfully implemented such an app for learning how to program.  



## How can we build such an app ourselves? 


We need practice problems. Many practice problems. These can be really small and easy questions, ideally with a few parameters that can be randomized. And then we just need an app that can render these problems. [AI Campus](https://ki-campus.org/?locale=en) already has a large collection of H5P problem sets for our AI related courses. So now, we only need to build a container app that can show these problems and save the results. Et voil√°! This can then be used by anyone to render their own H5P problem sets. 


## Live Demo and Prototype

Here you can try a very rudimentary first version: [Demo](https://appetize.io/app/wdbdk1wedngvn8y4uccbedf2q8?device=pixel4&scale=100)

And we are currently working on a wireframe prototype.
